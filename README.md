# Case-Study
A case study on retaliation of the DDOS cyber attack 
________________________________________
📄 Executive Summary 
Operation Sindoor, a cross-border military strike by India in May 2025, served as a flashpoint that dramatically escalated cyber warfare, particularly Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, against Indian digital infrastructure. This report analyzes the surge, characteristics, and impact of the DDoS campaign—a primary component of a multi-vector cyber response by pro-Pakistani and allied hacktivist groups.
The most significant finding is the unprecedented level of coordination and rapid escalation in hacktivist activity. Within hours of the kinetic strikes on May 7, 2025, DDoS attacks peaked, with over 75% targeting government entities. Key threat groups like RipperSec, AnonSec, and Keymous+ employed hybrid strategies, combining high-volume volumetric attacks with sophisticated, harder-to-detect application-layer floods. This campaign, along with associated malware and disinformation operations, demonstrated a critical shift in geopolitical conflicts, where cyberspace has become an immediate and active theatre of war.
While critical infrastructure entities largely maintained operations due to existing mitigations, the high volume of attacks, over 1.5 million cyber incidents recorded in the period, exposed vulnerabilities in less-hardened government, education, and public service portals. The report concludes with an urgent call for India to adopt a unified, AI-driven, Zero-Trust cyber defence architecture, prioritize indigenous DDoS mitigation solutions, and enact legislative reforms to counter the globally coordinated nature of modern hacktivism.
